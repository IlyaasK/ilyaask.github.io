<h2>DATE YOU</h2>

<p>Hey, I'm Ilyaas.</p>

<p>I am 20 years old, 5'9" or 174 cm looking for a monogamous relationship. I am currently living in Cincinnati Ohio, but plan on moving to SF/NYC soon.</p>

<p>This webpage was last updated on:<br>
You can contact me here</p>

<h3>Who I am:</h3>
<p>Secure attachment style<br>
Primary love languages: Physical Touch, Quality Time, Words of Affirmation.<br>
I can give most love languages liberally. Acts of Service and Gift giving does not come naturally, and will take time to experiment and learn.</p>

<h3>Feedback from my last long term relationship:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Broke</li>
<li>Can be rude when stressed or when focused and interrupted</li>
<li>Hurts without intending to touch</li>
<li>Wants me to change my last name</li>
</ul>

<p>I want to have kids at some point. Most likely when I am wealthy enough for consumer things to be virtually free and when I can homeschool them myself or pay for schools that make sense, e.g. Alpha School. I will be damned if I am going to teach my kid to ask permission to pee.</p>

<p>I do not believe in god. I was muslim and am now atheist. I get the belief but if your beliefs limit your agency, I am unlikely to make you happy. Otherwise, should be fine. I will happily tell our children why they should not believe though.</p>

<p>I am a man of routine, and want to be in one place while I build wealth. After that may be a nomadic lifestyle due to my love for mountain biking.</p>

<h3>Why you should not date me:</h3>
<ul>
<li>I eat homecooked or clean food (mostly chicken/rice/veggies). If you cook me a mean steak, I will not refuse though.</li>
<li>I train a lot.</li>
<li>You will get on creatine and other longevity routines, because I want to live for a long time, and if we get together, preferably with you, in the same vein, I hope I die earlier than you.</li>
<li>When we fight you will get no space, at least physically, but most likely mentally too. I am much more likely to hold you while you gather yourself than have you walk off.</li>
<li>Largely traditional values, I think. I am new to the american values so I may be wrong here.</li>
<li>I do not compromise on the big picture stuff</li>
</ul>

<p>I am looking for a partner, and the mother of my children. In this, I do not expect you to be housewife or homemaker because that job can be replaced for 40k USD/year, a mother on the other hand, I can say due to my mother can result in outlier outcomes.</p>

<p>I am looking for someone that believes in me even more than I do.</p>

<p>I am currently centering my life on getting smart so I can work on difficult and useful problems and create wealth via equity on the way. This is the goal for me to come to the US. Before this, I spent some time in new zealand because I wanted to be a professional mountain biker. There I discovered that I hate poverty more than I love mountain biking.</p>

<p>I live in ways that make sense to me, for example, I sleep on the floor, I am happy to do dinner dates but will carry my lunchbox with me. I recently learned it is polite in the US to wait for your friend to start eating. Which, why would I do that? Why would I want my friend to be hungrier for longer? Makes 0 sense.</p>

<p>I do have an asian toughness or rashness I would say, and I like that untamed part of me. I have been described as the youngest old man I know, raw and real, annoying, real and loving.</p>

<p>I will most likely go all in soon to try to break things once I am aligned, so in case things don't work out we save the most time and in case we do, I can love you for longer.</p>

<p>I enjoy routine and the mundane.</p>

<p>Currently I am solving a problem that involves hardware and prototyping a solution. The market seems to be relatively small but high income. Solutions seem to be DIYed but no official solutions exist.</p>

<p>I would love a TVD kind of love but have learned enough to not expect that. What I am looking for now can be accurately summed up in a cofounder for my life and family, possibly business. It could be summed up as the hormozis or courtney and CBum. As long as I am better with you, I want to be with you, because I want to be better. This could be on the homefront, on the business front, or you could be an artist and have that dynamic. I am open to most things.</p>

<p>I may want to go back to NZ when raising children but that is quite far away.</p>

<p>Life is short, and we will all die. Text me to get unlimited kisses.</p>
